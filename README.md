## Introduction
MyResult is an online result management system designed to provide worldwide access to examination results.

Administrators and authorized staff members have the privileges to add, modify, and delete results and student records. Additionally, administrators can manage staff members, including adding, modifying, deleting, and assigning roles to them. Students can select their exam and enter their specific ID to view their results.
